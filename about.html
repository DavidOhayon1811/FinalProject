        <h3>Who I am.</h3>
        <p>
          My name is David Ohayon, I'm fifteen. I live in the south of Tel Aviv,
          Israel, in a neighborhood called "Neve-Tsedek". Before I lived in
          Israel, I lived in Paris, France, in the 11th arrondissement
          (district). I moved to Israel in August 2014. It's been 5 years and 9
          months now that I live in Israel. Lots of French families like mine
          have been moving to Neve-Tsedek lately. I like Tel-Aviv more than
          Paris for those few but significant reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The weather is better here and it makes the vacations way more fun
            than it is in Paris, it rains most of the time in that town.
          </li>
          <li>
            The people are nicer and helpful, if they see someone in distress
            they'd help them right away and that's something that you wouldn't
            see in Paris, there people just dodge every person that needs help.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I study at a school named Yeshiva Bar-Ilan, it's located at 124
          rothschild street, Tel-Aviv. It's a Yeshiva, which means that all
          students are boys and that half our school subjects are about Judaism,
          the other half is about physics, math, computer sciences :) etc.
          School in Israel is so different than where I was studying in France
          but in a good way.

        <h3>What I do.</h3>
        <p>
          I have lots of hobbies and here is a little list of a few of my
          hobbies:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Tennis</li>
          <li>Soccer</li>
          <li>Basketball</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          but nowadays it's a bit more complicated to practice those sports
          because of social distancing. For the last weeks I've been playing
          video games with my friends, I don't possess a lot of video games,
          here is a few of them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rocket League, imagine a soccer game with cars instead of players.
            it's fun but porbably the hardest game I've ever tried.
          </li>
          <li>
            Minecraft, we generally play on the HyPixel server TNT Games and
            BedWars with my friends.
          </li>
          <li>
            Golf it, golf may not sound fun but it's one of the most fun games
            I've ever played.
          </li>
          <p>
            I really like playing with my friends it makes me laugh and happy.
