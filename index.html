          This is my Final Project of 10th Grade, I'm very happy about it. I
          learnt tons about web development while I was making this project
          like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Usage of an Api, getting information (data) from another site and
            displaying it on my own for example I used an Api for displaying all
            my photos on the image gallery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Local Storage, how to store what the user's done or chosen and
            maintain it on refresh and saved across browser sessions. It's very
            useful when you need to save the user's preferences on your website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Css Flexbox, The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the
            container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height to best fill
            the available space mostly to accommodate to all kind of display
            devices and screen sizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Media queries, they're useful when you want to modify your site or
            depending on the user's device or specific characteristics and
            parameters such as screen resolution or browser viewport width.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now that you know what I learned, I'm going to give you a tour of this
          project.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            First you should check out the about page to learn a little bit
            about me and my life, you can also contact me there if you'd like.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next there's the immage gallery, I talked a bit about it before. The
            photos comes from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">pexels.com</a>.
            You can look at the "curated photos" (some random photos given by
            pexels) when you load the page, you also have the possibility to
            search for photos.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now that you've seen and explored the surroundings of my project,
          let's get to the main part: the projects, you can access them by
          clicking on the dropdown button.
        </p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>
            First Project is "The BeatMaker". This one is pretty fun, all you've
            got to do is click on the Kick, Snare and Hihats boxes and press
            play to make awesome beats. You have a variety of Kick, Snare and
            Hihats classic to electro that you can try out, you can alse change
            the tempo, lower to chill and higher to rock. To create the perfect
            beat, then you can mute each track with the mute button to
            perfectionate your beat.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second one called "ToDo List" is rather basic but very useful.
            If you ever forget your timetable, then you should use the ToDo
            List. You can write whatever you need to do throughout your day. and
            check it whenever you're finished with the task or even delete it to
            completely forget about it. If you ever closed your ToDo List tab,
            you can just open it back and every one of the tasks that you've
            added to your list will be there. (there's a small bug though, if
            you've checked one of the task and refresh the page then the task
            will be there but unchecked)
          </li>
          <li>
            The last one is "The Coloors" project and was strongly inspired from
            the site
            <a href="https://coolors.co/generate">coolors.co</a> but I literally
            just replaced the place of the double "o". With this project you can
            generate creative palettes of colors, save them with their
            respective name, open them in your library and even edit them. To
            create the perfect palette you have multiple ways. You can generate
            colors, lock one you like and repeat the process until you have
            created the perfect palette. You can also edit the hue, brightness
            and saturation of each color to find the perfect color for your
            palette. and by clicking on the hexadecimal color text the hex code
            will be automatically copied to your clipboard.
